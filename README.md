# hypotext

Lightweight implementations of HTML to plain text conversion, as close to "rendered" as can be.


The target algorithm is similar to the HTML5 DOM's [`HTMLElement.innerText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) property, but without taking layout or styling into account.
